Chess PGN, [Portable Game Notation](http://www.saremba.de/chessgml/standards/pgn/pgn-complete.htm), Javascript Library

# Why Another?

1. multiple games parsing and generation
2. comprehensive, all comments and variations
3. sync for CLI use, async for large file handling
4. single dependency [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js), exported again
